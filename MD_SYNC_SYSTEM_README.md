# 📄 Markdown-to-Database Sync System

## Overview

The Enhanced Task Manager provides a complete workflow for keeping markdown task files synchronized with the Baserow database, featuring an approval system that only merges changes to the main branch after manual approval.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Live File Monitoring**
- Watches `tasks/*.md` files for changes every 2 seconds
- Detects new tasks, modifications, and deletions
- Preserves existing approval states during updates

### 2. **Intelligent Task Parsing**
- Extracts tasks from markdown using multiple patterns:
  - `- [ ] Task description` (checkbox format)
  - `- [x] Completed task` (completed checkbox)
  - `- Task description` (bullet points under agent sections)
- Parses agent assignments from `### 🎨 **Agent-Name**` sections
- Automatically determines priority, estimated hours, and tags

### 3. **Feature Group Management**
- Groups tasks by category (Analytics, Dashboard, Calendar, etc.)
- Each group has its own approval status
- Bulk approve/disapprove entire feature groups
- Individual task-level approval controls

### 4. **Approval Workflow**
- ✅ **Approve**: Mark tasks as ready for production
- ❌ **Needs Work**: Require changes with feedback notes
- 📝 **Notes System**: Add detailed feedback for each task/group
- 🔄 **Conflict Detection**: Identifies changes between MD and database

### 5. **Git Integration**
- Auto-generates commits when groups are approved
- Creates structured commit messages with task lists
- Supports branching workflow (feature → main)
- Tracks commit history and file changes

   - See commit messages with task details

## 📋 Task File Format

### Supported Patterns

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Agent Responsibility Breakdown

### 🎨 **UI-Designer** - Description
- [ ] Design task with checkbox (pending)
- [x] Completed task with checkbox (done)
- Regular bullet point task (auto-detected)
- High priority task ~2h (with time estimate)

### 👨‍💻 **Frontend-Developer** - Description  
- Build responsive components
- Implement interactive features ~30min
- Fix critical bug (urgent priority)
```

### Task Parsing Rules

1. **Agent Assignment**: Tasks under `### **Agent-Name**` are assigned to that agent
2. **Completion Status**: `[x]` = completed, `[ ]` = pending
3. **Priority Detection**: Keywords like "critical", "urgent", "high priority"
4. **Time Estimates**: `~2h`, `~30min` format
5. **Category**: Derived from filename (e.g., `dashboard.md` → "Dashboard Features")

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup

```typescript
// src/environments/environment.ts
export const environment = {
  baserow: {
    apiUrl: 'https://db.jollycares.com/api/database/rows/table',
    token: 'YOUR_BASEROW_TOKEN',
    tables: {
      tasks: 508,
      taskUpdates: 509,
      agents: 506,
      projects: 507
    }
  }
};
```

### File Watching Settings

- **Method**: Polling every 2 seconds
- **Watched Directory**: `src/assets/tasks/` (served by Angular dev server)
- **File Pattern**: `*.md`
- **Change Detection**: SHA-256 hash comparison

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **File Access Errors**
   - Markdown files not found in `habiti/tasks/` directory
   - Tasks server not running on port 3001
   - Check file paths and ensure server is started

2. **Database Connection**
   - Baserow API token invalid or expired
   - Use "Test Baserow Connection" button to verify

3. **Parsing Errors**
   - Invalid markdown format
   - Agent sections without proper `### **Agent**` format
   - Check browser console for parsing details

4. **Sync Conflicts**
   - Manual database changes conflict with markdown
   - Review conflicts in the UI and resolve manually

### Troubleshooting

1. **Force Sync All**
   - Reloads all markdown files and reprocesses
   - Useful after manual file changes

2. **Download Full Report**
   - Exports complete system state as markdown
   - Helpful for debugging and status reviews

3. **Legacy Fallback**
   - Access old task manager at `/legacy-task-manager`
   - Provides manual task management if sync fails
